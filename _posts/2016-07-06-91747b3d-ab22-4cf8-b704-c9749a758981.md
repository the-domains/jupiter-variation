_**Act Up Trio - Act Up (2013)**_

Act Up Trio come from Thessaloniki, Greece with the three members consisting the group having a long and significant history in the local and European Jazz scenes.

Their only release so far is Act Up 7-inch which was recorded live in the Royal Alzheimer Hall studios of Epanomi, Greece during January of 2013 and was subsequently released in July of the same year. It consists of two songs, original composition Yedi Kule (taking its name from the Ottoman era prison located in Thessaloniki) and Reference to Soropis which is an improvisation based on the greek-rebetiko era song O Soropis initially performed by Kostas Roukounas in 1936\.

Well, the key word here is improvisation. Carrying an obvious (and of course strong) Jazz background, the trio lets the performances evolve and expand freely reaching to a final outcome that several times touches the limits of punk (one observant enough will even notice the word punk in the tag area of group's Bandcamp page). Act Up Trio are definitely punk in the way they approach their art and me being brave (and cliche) enough, I would name them Greece's answer to John Zorn.

If I could find only one fault in Act Up Trio, that would be the limited display of their craft during the 6 years of their existence (they were established in 2010) with this 7-inch being their only release. However all three members are over-productive with their other bands and music projects (one can easily access information about these in bands webpage).
