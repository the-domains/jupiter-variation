_**Natvre's - Wrath (2016)**_
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/35baf9538d2c5a6757b64f454f89b5061a3fe3d8.jpg)

Nearly halfway 2016 and I have already found my first serious candidate for this year's best Black Metal album. **Natvre's **are coming from Greece but honestly do not expect to hear anything like **Rotting Christ** or **Varathron** here. What you are going to experience instead, is one of the best Norwegian Black Metal records that never came out of Norway. **Natvre's** get their influences from bands like **Burzum** (minus the politics) and **Darkthrone** (plus better aesthetics) and what really makes them standout is the way that they have digested and finally express these influences in their final artistic outcome. I chose the term "artistic" very carefully here but art is something that is supposed to create sentiments and feelings to people and judging by the chill I get in my spine every time I listen to the eight and half minutes of **Hinterland **we are definitely talking about art in this case.

Initially released in 100 copies in a beautiful digipack (the aesthetics I wrote about earlier) **Wrath** can be acquired by contacting the band in one of the following ways :

Bandcamp:

High chances are that this masterpiece is already sold out. In that case you can have a look in **Discogs** (where I got my copy in normal price) or wait for the second press which I know is already in the works.
