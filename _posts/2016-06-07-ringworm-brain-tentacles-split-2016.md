**_Ringworm / Brain Tentacles Split (2016)_**

In anticipation of their new album (out on July 29 via **Relapse**), **Ringworm** release this special split 7-inch with Jazz-noise super-group **Brain Tentacles**. As anyone can easily understand from the cover, here we have two cover versions (**Venom** and **Celtic Frost **respectively****one for each band) plus 3 original songs. 

**Ringworm **performance****comes as no surprise, the short (under two minutes) **Destroy or Create** and **Venom's Poison** are delivered in the usual, well known, high quality, blasting style that the band never fails to offer. However, the highlight of this split single is **Brain Tentacles**. Bypassing their interpretation of **Celtic Frost's Innocence and Wrath**, it is in the other two songs of this single (original compositions **Kingda Ka** and **The Spoiler**) where they really rise and shine. Their mixture of Jazz, Grindcore and Noise brings only one name in mind...**John Zorn's Naked City **and****after****having a more thorough look in the names of the members of this super group, you are soon left without doubts regarding their influences, their aesthetics and the expected quality of the result...drummer Dave Witte (**Municipal Waste**, **Discordance Axis**), saxophonist Bruce Lamont (**Corrections House**, **Yakuza**) and bassist Aaron Dallison (from the criminally underrated **Keelhaul**)...with such a roaster how can the result fail...6,66 $ are nothing compared to the real value of this 7-inch.
