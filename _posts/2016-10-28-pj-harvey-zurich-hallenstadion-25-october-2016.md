  Choosing a weekday evening (and especially a Tuesday) is not a success factor
  when it comes to concert ticket sales. These were my first thoughts at the
  moment I disembarked from the tram in front of an almost empty entrance of
  Zurichâ€™s Hallenstadion. After double checking my ticket (in order to ensure
  that I am in the correct venue) I entered the stadium and proceeded to the
  concert hall. 45 minutes before the official concert start and what I was
  seeing was heartbreaking. Less than 200 people in a venue that in its full
  capacity can accommodate 13.000 attendants. For tonights concert, the scene
  had been setup in the middle of the field creating a venue for 2.000 - 3.000
  but until that moment the omens where still not good. I went to my seat and
  after a couple of minutes a very polite lady from the crew, informed me (in
  Swiss German) that If I want I can move to the arena as there would be enough
  capacity this night (for the ones who are not familiar with the Swiss respect
  and adherence to the rules, normally such a change is strictly forbidden due
  to safety reasons). With a very convincing and almost apologetic face she also
  explained that she understands that I have paid more for a seat so If I wish I
  could remain in the nearly empty side of the seated places. The omens for
  tonight were becoming more and more worse but I decided not to let this affect
  my mood so I grabbed a beer and moved down to the arena (where by that time,
  30 min before the concert start, you could easily set up a small football
  match).

Choosing a weekday evening (and especially a Tuesday) is not a success factor when it comes to concert ticket sales. These were my first thoughts at the moment I disembarked from the tram in front of an almost empty entrance of Zurich's Hallenstadion. After double checking my ticket (in order to ensure that I am in the correct venue) I entered the stadium and proceeded to the concert hall. 45 minutes before the official concert start and what I was seeing was heartbreaking. Less than 200 people in a venue that in its full capacity can accommodate 13.000 attendants. For tonights concert, the scene had been setup in the middle of the field creating a venue for 2.000 - 3.000 but until that moment the omens where still not good. I went to my seat and after a couple of minutes a very polite lady from the crew, informed me (in Swiss German) that If I want I can move to the arena as there would be enough capacity this night (for the ones who are not familiar with the Swiss respect and adherence to the rules, normally such a change is strictly forbidden due to safety reasons). With a very convincing and almost apologetic face she also explained that she understands that I have paid more for a seat so If I wish I could remain in the nearly empty side of the seated places. The omens for tonight were becoming more and more worse but I decided not to let this affect my mood so I grabbed a beer and moved down to the arena (where by that time, 30 min before the concert start, you could easily set up a small football match).

This proved finally a strategic move because in the last 15 minutes people started to massively arrive so that by the time **PJ Harvey** appeared on stage, there were approximately 3.000 viewers spread in the arena and the seated places. This "On time" arrival maybe normal for a country where every thing operates like a Swiss clock and punctuality is a strong part of the culture but for me (a person who took half day off from work in order to be on time for the concert) still seems difficult to get used to.
![A fine example of Swiss obsession with punctuality](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5d1164c0-7fb6-4ad1-85a3-9aa7f823d994.jpg)

At 10 minutes past 20:00 (neither very English nor very Swiss from punctuality point of view),**PJ Harvey** and her band entered the stage marching with **PJ** herself being in between and not in the lead. This was a strong statement of how important is the role of her musicians and became apparent during the whole duration of the concert. I have to say that although I am a huge fan of **PJ Harvey**, I did not fully adored her last album. I somehow felt that she focused on the message (fully respected as a decision) and left the songwriting in the second place. So I was holding a small basket for that night but somehow the live delivery (which apparently included 9 songs from the new album) worked perfectly and I think that this was due to **PJ Harvey's** charismatic persona on one hand who with her moves and charm was seducing the audience for nearly two hours and on the other hand due to the musicians who elevated the songs higher than the studio versions. And it is probably this contrast of feelings and the sudden rise from an initial evening of low expectations to a night of fun that makes me consider this concert to be in the top 10 of the ones that I have ever watched.
