**_Zatokrev - Silk Spiders Underwater... (2015)_**

**Zatokrev** formed in 2002 in Basel, Switzerland. According to their Facebook page, they play "Apocalypse Metal" (sic), nevertheless I would say that if there is one band that has defined the sound and the aesthetics of them, this is **Neurosis**. **Silk Spiders Uderwater...** is their 4th official release (they have also released a split CD with **Vancouver**) and is the first of two concept albums with the second one, named **...Bring Mirrors To The Surface, **scheduled ****to be released somewhere between 2016 and 2017\.

As you may have already understood, **Zatokrev** play sludge metal BUT there are certain elements in this album that put them in the first league of the genre and -at least to my humble opinion- place them amongst equals next to bands like **Cult Of Luna. **The first one is the production (done in Geneva guaranteeing the presence of the famous Swiss quality in doing things) and which allows the dynamics and the multiple dimensions of the songs to become clear to the listener. The second one is the excellent musicianship which helps the ideas behind the compositions to evolve freely. Having these aces up their sleeves, it is easy for **Zatokrev** to rise and shine in **Silk Spiders Underwater... **Songs like **Bleeding Island **or **Brick In The Sky**, which is the highlight of the CD, have rightfully conquered a place in my sludge/post metal playlists next to masterpieces like **Carry **by **Isis, Stones From the Sky **by**Neurosis **and most recently **Cygnus **by**Cult Of Luna. **

**Silk Spiders Underwater... **is(was) one of the best albums of 2015 - it's too bad that I only discovered it in 2016...
