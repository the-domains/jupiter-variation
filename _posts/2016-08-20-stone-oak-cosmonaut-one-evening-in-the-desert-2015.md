_**Stone Oak Cosmonaut - One Evening in the Desert (2015)**_

**Stone Oak Cosmonaut** are one of those bands who do not really seem to care much about publicity. A quick search on the internet will convince you : a Facebook page that has not been updated since one year, a link that directs to the bands myspace for their first album (**Out of Orbit **- 2007), a reference in Metal Archives that mentions only their first two albums, a Discogs page with the correct discography but no further comment and that's it. This is really a pity - and I am writing this as someone who has bought all their three albums and adores their material - because the world needs to hear more of their music ! **One Evening in the Desert** is their third CD, released one year ago and despite me belonging to the band followers I got to know about it only a few months back. Never mind, there is always time to do things correct so this is a presentation.

Album opens with the self titled **One Evening in the Desert,** which is a beautiful psychedelic rock song. Good opener but the best is yet to come. Second song **Cosmic Messenger **is one of the CD's strongest tracks. A Doom hymn with a 70's vibe. Third song **Outside** is a Mötörhead tribute. Lacks originality but it's fun as hell. **Mind Full of Capsules **which follows, is a 13 minute space rock hymn where **Stone Oak Cosmonaut** show their craft. Great song (especially the guitar work) but still not the album's best. **Stone And Light** has one of the greatest riffs that I have ever heard but wait, still we have not reached the highlight of this record...

...which is the next song, the twelve minute **Voyagers**. A Pink Floyd-esque, atmospheric voyage to Stone Oak Cosmonaut's universe which builds up and 2 minutes before the end escalates to one of the best jams that I have heard. Outstanding! **The Sun **is another 70's hard rock anthem with a fantastic solo. Song number eight, **Incident In Galaxy Nine** is a wonderful 7 and half minutes instrumental where once again, the guitar work is exquisite. Album closer, **Festival **is a depart from the album heaviness. A beautiful, psychedelic melody creates one of these songs that always end up in your summer holiday mixtapes (it did mine at least).

If you like stone, space, psychedelic rock with strong 70's influences, definitely buy this album. The music world would be a more fair place if bands like **Stone Oak Cosmonaut** could reach to more people.
