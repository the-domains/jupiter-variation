_**Stheno/World Downfall Split 7-inch EP (2016)**_

My biggest problem with political grindcore is that by the moment you drop the needle on the turntable, turn your back, walk to the fridge to grab a beer, you have to immediately return and change the record side. Of course, someone could counter-suggest that if a band is able to write single minute dynamites that are able to transfer the message clearly and straightforward then there is no reason to consume time and energy in repeated choruses and useless solos...and you know, in the case of **Stheno** and **World Downfall** this statement would be absolutely right. 1 7inch, 2 sides, 6 songs, approximately 8 minutes of magnificent ultra fast, political grindcore.
