_****Emilie Zoé** - Dead-End Tape (2016)**_
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ef684d6c-71e6-4fd7-84e8-fbaedb2d28b8.jpg)

What a beautiful album this is! Imagine **PJ Harvey** (**To Bring You My Love** era) with an essence of **Portishead** melancholia, sometimes uptempo (**Little Liar**) but without getting dark or melodramatic. Just a voice, a guitar and some percussion in the background, singing over simple song structures...how is it possible that this has become my favourite listening for this summer's evenings? Well, I guess songs like **I Cried In My Beard** provide the answer.

**Emilie Zoé** is from Neuchâtel, Switzerland and this is her first full album (an E.P. titled **Empty** has preceded).
