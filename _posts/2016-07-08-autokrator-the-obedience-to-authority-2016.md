****_Autokrator - The Obedience to Authority (2016)_**__**

This is undoubtedly one of the most extreme albums that I have ever heard. **Autokrator** (means Emperor in Greek) are coming from France and although their 2015 self-named first album has gathered ambiguous reviews, here in their second attempt they continue by following the exact same artistic direction. Hyper speed drumming, absolute no groove, no melodies, no solos, only a cold, long, monotonous, seething, sludge, filthy, asphyxiating death metal . **Autokrator's** sound is raw, violent, rude and indiscrete but in the same time addictively attractive. Never heard a more beautiful cacophony before.
