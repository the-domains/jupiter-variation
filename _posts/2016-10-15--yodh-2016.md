  One question that constantly revolves around my head is what can really help a
  musician standout and survive in today’s landscape of over-information, short
  attention span (audience-wise) and oversupply of musical output. There are
  hundreds of new albums coming out each month, thousands (literally) of blogs
  and music portals out there and me personally, both as a fan and a collector,
  really struggle to absorb all the amount of available music and keep my
  collection decently up to date. In this matter, Internet has been both a
  blessing and a curse. Nowadays, most of the music is at your disposal with a
  mouse-click but on the other hand this “over convenience” has removed the
  personal part from the music listening process. You click, you listen for some
  minutes and if the album does not keep your attention you abort and send the
  files to the computer trashcan. On the other hand, in the cases you physically
  purchase an album, by the time it arrives at your hands you have most probably
  already listened to it a couple of times and you only file it in your shelves
  for archiving or completist reasons (out of where most probably it will very
  rarely come out again since you can listen it in Spotify or in your
  smartphone). What I really miss are the times when I was waiting for Saturday
  morning to come, in order to embark for my trip towards the city centre, visit
  all the record stores one by one holding the list I was thoroughly compiling
  the previous weeks, make my fingers dirty and sore from searching and finally
  return home, isolate in my room and spend the rest of the weekend listening to
  my newly purchased records and noting down the songs which would be later
  included in my mix-tapes.

One question that constantly revolves around my head is what can really help a musician standout and survive in today's landscape of over-information, short attention span (audience-wise) and oversupply of musical output. There are hundreds of new albums coming out each month, thousands (literally) of blogs and music portals out there and me personally, both as a fan and a collector, really struggle to absorb all the amount of available music and keep my collection decently up to date. In this matter, Internet has been both a blessing and a curse. Nowadays, most of the music is at your disposal with a mouse-click but on the other hand this "over convenience" has removed the personal part from the music listening process. You click, you listen for some minutes and if the album does not keep your attention you abort and send the files to the computer trashcan. On the other hand, in the cases you physically purchase an album, by the time it arrives at your hands you have most probably already listened to it a couple of times and you only file it in your shelves for archiving or completist reasons (out of where most probably it will very rarely come out again since you can listen it in **Spotify** or in your smartphone). What I really miss are the times when I was waiting for Saturday morning to come, in order to embark for my trip towards the city centre, visit all the record stores one by one holding the list I was thoroughly compiling the previous weeks, make my fingers dirty and sore from searching and finally return home, isolate in my room and spend the rest of the weekend listening to my newly purchased records and noting down the songs which would be later included in my mix-tapes.

This was quite a big intro but thoughts like these come to my mind in the case of **מזמור **(or **Mizmor** - which means Psalm in Hebrew). **מזמור **are an one man band coming from Salem, Oregon and this is their second full length (plus several EPs and split singles). **מזמור **have managed to build already a hype around their name (and this is mainly due to websites like **Vice**) so I have to say that when I pressed the play button in their **Bandcamp** page I was pretty much prepared to listen to something really special and exquisite. Truth is so, however I am just thinking how I would have probably reacted had I listened to **Yodh **(the name of the album) unprepared and for the first time in my turntable. I can only suppose that the shock would compare with the time when I was 15 years old and listened to **Leprosy** for the first time !

Focusing on the music, **מזמור **play slow and cold Doom/Black Metal. The song durations are between 10 and 14 minutes and as explained in their website, their whole existence is an one-man's heavy music exploration as a way of dealing with his personal mental and spiritual anguish. Obviously, **מזמור **artistic delivery is something totally personal and being so it clearly reflects to their music which is cold and distant. This distance gives and extra element of attraction (at least to me and probably coming from a voyeuristic point of view). **Yodh** is far beyond or above of a metal album (of whatever genre). It is an honest and daring soul deposition. It is the artistic expression of an agonising attempt to find the catharsis out of a life long depression. All these make it a masterpiece in its own terms.
