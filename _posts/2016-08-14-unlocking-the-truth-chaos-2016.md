**Unlocking the Truth **became an internet sensation in 2012, as the band of three 11 year olds who used to perform live in Times Square. Gaining quickly a viral status - granting them access to big television networks like NBC, ABC, CNN, Comedy Central, Fuse, appearance slots in big festivals like Coachella (becoming the youngest group ever to perform there), SxSW, Vans Warped Tour and support gigs to Guns 'n Roses, Mötörhead, Marilyn Manson, Queens of the Stone Age among others - they signed a $1.8 Million deal with Sony Music Entertainment out of which they successfully managed to negotiate their exit in 2015\. After all the ups and downs they have finally managed to release their first full album **Chaos **in July 2016 and the first immediate question that comes to mind, is the obvious one : Does it really stand up to the hype ?

The answer is YES. The musicianship in **Chaos** is great, the songs have catchy hooks and melodies (like in my personal favourite **Made of Stone**), the guitar riffs are exquisite ( just listen to the guitar work in **Monster **or in**Faywb**) and generally one can easily say that the band composes and plays music with the self-confidence of scene veterans. The only remark that I would dare to make is that in some points, the attempt to incorporate as many of their influences as possible is apparent and this disorientates the final result. Nevertheless, to correct this is only a matter of experience and digestion (of their influences) and I honestly hope that **Unlocking the Truth** stay long united as a band in order to achieve this. Doing my math, they must be now 15-16 years old so the music world has a lot to expect from them. All in all, a refreshing album.
