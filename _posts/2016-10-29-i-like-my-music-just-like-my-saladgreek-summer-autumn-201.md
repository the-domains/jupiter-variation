# _**I like my music, just like my salad...Greek (Summer-Autumn 2016 Version)**_

Greek scene is alive and kicking so I have decided to present some of the best releases that came into my hands during this summer-autumn. Enjoy and support your local scene, wherever you are...

**Sarabante - Poisonous Legacy**
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/961b05a971588329bab096ab4909a49989678c97.jpg)

**Poisonous Legacy** is considered by many the album that will define the Greek crust core scene, however I consider such statements as stupidly obsolete. Hardcore and Crust has always been a strong point in Greece, therefore I do not think that any kind of reference or benchmarking is needed (and especially in a mostly politicised genre). In their second album (3d release overall) **Sarabante** continue to deliver their trademark dark and ferocious crust core with excellent guitar melodies. For the ones who like bands like **Tragedy**, this is a must.

**Foray Between Ocean - Depression Neverending**

Well, I have to say that this one came out of nowhere and struck me in the head. The members of **Foray Between Ocean** come from several prominent Greek bands (**Trendy Hooligans**, **Sorrowful Angels**, **Outloud**, **Sunburst**) and in their debut they present one of the most insanely technical Metalcore albums I have ever heard. Having the advantage of a HUGE production (which eventually helps them present their musicianship skills to the full extend) the 11 songs of **Depression Neverending** are characterised by great riffs, catchy melodies, atmospheric keyboards and some of the greatest drumming that has ever been recorded in a Greek metal album. **Foray Between Ocean** manage to create a fusion from a variety of metal sub-genres (from High Speed Black Metal, Atmospheric Death, Swedish influenced NWOAHM, Clean Vocals Metal Core) but in a way that the final result is neither a joke nor an insult. **Depression Neverending** may not be inventing the wheel but it is one of the most enjoyable records I have ever purchased. Spend your money without any concern.

**Kataxnia - Stin Skia Mias Lemitomou**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/623f24c8-a2f8-45c0-b81e-e66bb334386a.jpg)

**Kataxnia** play Crust core however the overall vocal delivery (helped by the pessimistic lyrics which are sung in Greek), the melodramatic guitar melodies, the clean production and the inclusion of piano and violin parts result in a more melancholic output (compared to **Sarabante**). **Kataxnia's **second album is not easy material, however this should not stop anyone from buying (or at least listening) to this gem...

**Planet of Zeus - Loyal to the Pack**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e04e7d49-82f9-40b0-b942-b49a5fe56929.jpg)

I am really having a hard time to understand why **Loyal to the Pack** divided the (Greek mainly) listeners so much. Probably because this is usually how it happens with albums that are eventually proven influential : people find it difficult to understand their importance in the beginning... **Planet of Zeus** have obviously reached their maturity and, paraphrasing the album title, the only thing that they owe to be loyal to is their artistic integrity. If you want my humble opinion, I REALLY HOPE that this album becomes a reference point for the Greek bands in the future. We need more songs like **Retreat **to be written. Essential...

**Omega Monolith - Fungus**
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e7b95ea0aef77ac69e47cb8e73ac2881d9b34f8a.jpg)

**Omega Monolith's** music resembles very much a living organism...during the three songs of **Fungus,** the listener is experiencing the birth, evolution and the sudden death of their Music in a trip which, according to the song titles, seems to follow an inverse direction in time...If I should give only one name to **Omega Monolith's** music that would be ALIVE music...

**Tardive Dyskinesia - Harmonic Confusion**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8e615dea-088b-4f3f-b223-35288037805b.jpg)

Paraphrasing the album title (I like doing this) **Tardive Dyskinesia's** progressive metal is harmonic (just listen how perfectly the saxophone parts fit in **Savior Complex**... ) but not confusing. Already scene veterans (this is their 4th release) they always had the tunes and the skills but now they also have the proper exposure to descend out from the Greek underground. I will easily put this next to the new **Meshuggah, Gojira, Candiria** and **Wathtower **in my 2016 lists...

**1000 Mods - Repeated Exposure to...**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ccb444da-9675-46f5-b7ea-d9f09c526c40.jpg)

I have never been a big fan of Stoner rock and this one is my first exposure to **1000 Mods, **so probably that makes my opinion more trustworthy (in terms of objectivity at least). So, forget the usual generic second class **Black Sabbath** copycats that the majority of the stoner bands are since here we are talking about real music. **1000 Mods** have created a hype around their name recently but imho they deserve it (anyone who has written a song like **The Son** and is touring their asses off around Europe given the current Greek financial landscape would).

**Sadhus "the smoking community" / Agnes Vein - Split 7"**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6360a6ef-96d3-4ff4-a90c-197c1b04f0ef.jpg)

If there was more justice in this world, here we would have two separate albums instead of a two song split 7-inch. **Agnes Vein's **Doom is influenced by Black Metal while **Sadhus "the smoking community" **are oriented more on the sludge side of it. Both songs are undoubtedly of high quality, however anyone who would like to get more exposure to both bands should definitely give a listen to their previous releases.
