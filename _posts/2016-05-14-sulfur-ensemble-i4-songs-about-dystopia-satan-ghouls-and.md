_**Sülfür Ensemble - I (4 Songs About Dystopia, Satan, Ghouls & Marilyn Monroe) 2016**_

**Sülfür Ensemble **are a 4 piece coming from Istanbul Turkey (the cursed land as they proclaim) and they play fuzzy Doom 'n Roll. **I (4 Songs About Dystopia, Satan, Ghouls & Marilyn Monroe)** is their first output (for the moment available only in digital platforms like **Bandcamp **and **Soundcloud** even though plans exist for a physical release in the future). The title of the E.P. is absolutely explanatory about the content of the songs :

**Daily Hate **: E.P. opener is sooooo heavy. It starts slowly having a fuzzy guitar sound that would make **Tony Iommi** proud but just around 4:58 the song explodes. What a great start!

**Plea** : This is the album highlight. Same approach as the first song but obviously much more worked as a composition. Just listen to the guitar work in this piece! Candidate for one of this year's best songs. Non Serviam!

**Karaçor** : I love the "dirtiness" in the vocals here and the way that this song ends (the combination of the guitar feedback and the repetitive screaming "Karaçor" nails it).

**Marilyn** : The grooviest of the 4 songs, has a more punkish approach and in combination with the title and the lyrical content it brought to my mind bands like Misfits and Cathedral. This would be the single of the record.

Overall, **I** is a promising release which sets the standards high and "prepares" our appetite for a full album.
