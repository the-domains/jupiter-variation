_**Sumac - What One Becomes (2016)**_

**Sumac **have returned and their second release, **What One Becomes**, is heavier and darker than ever! Album beginner, **Image of Control**, sets pretty much the expectations starting with 4 minutes of monotonous cacophony until the voice of **Aaron Turner** kicks in and transforms the noise into a stunning composition. With none of its 5 songs being below 9 minutes, **What One Becomes** continues in the same manner. Tribal rhythms (**Blackout**), slow tempos, repeated patterns, lack of melodies, no post-atmospheric parts, absolutely nothing at all that could make this record an easy listening. Just 60 minute of solid heaviness. For sure this is an album that needs time to evolve and many listens for one to scratch behind the surface of heaviness and darkness and uncover the hidden beauty. To my own ears, **Sumac's** delivery has more in common with **Swans** than **Isis**. Someone may disagree but since when listening to music has become a non-personal matter? Starting with **Oceanic**, **Aaron Turner's** art has accompanied some of the darkest moments of my life. If there is one thing that I wish for, is to have more of his art and less of the dark moments in my life.
