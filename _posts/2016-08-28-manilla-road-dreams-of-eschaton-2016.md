## _**Manilla Road - Dreams of Eschaton (2016)**_

As someone who was born in the 70s, started listening to metal in the mid 80s (and in other words has lived throughout the "golden-era" of traditional heavy metal), I have a very clear view why bands like **Manilla Road** (or **Warlord **- but that's another story) never managed to access big audiences during their time. To my humble opinion there have been two main reasons for this (and none of them was related to their skills or the quality of their material) :

One, was the arrogant snobbism of the music press (especially in U.K.) where anything that their small minds could not comprehend was immediately intimidated. **Kerrang** once named **Manilla Road** as "the world's ugliest band" while in one of "**The Courts of Chaos**" (last album before their split between 1992-1994) reviews (I think it was in **Kerrang** again) it was mentioned that even if the album was the last piece of toilet paper on earth, the journalist (whose name I do not currently recall) would not bother to wipe his ass with it...those were the times...

Second (and most enraging reason) was the idiotic "True metal" elitism in countries like Greece which was always trying to keep bands like **Manilla Road** away from the masses and make them relevant only for the "initiated" and chosen ones. This started as a defence mechanism against the rise of Thrash metal at that time (when every release carrying the Roadrunner/Roadracer label was selling like warm bread) and ended up to a shitload of obscure vinyl records (which most of them were shit anyway) being sold overpriced in the Sunday flea markets.

I was familiar with the material of "**Dreams of Eschaton**" thanks (sic) to the self titled 1999 bootleg given for free with an issue of the Greek **Metal Invader **magazine (without the band knowing of course)...yes, magazines giving away bootlegs - once again, those were the times...nonetheless, the sound quality in this official rerelease is light years far away better. Some words about the background behind this release copied from the **Nuclear War Now Productions** forum (http://www.nwnprod.com/) :

> _Back in the mid 90's I first heard of the unreleased Manilla Road album from 1981, recorded between "Invasion" and "Metal". Over several years I managed to get a couple of different dubs of this material through a variety of sources, hoping to find the best sounding version. At the time John Perez was spreading around one of the better copies out there. It boggled the mind that such a masterpiece was unreleased. _  
> _Anyway in 2002 this material was finally officially released as "Mark of the Beast". I was very happy to see it. Sometime before that I had acquired a cassette that originated from Mark Shelton, it came from the archive of one of the owners of 80's metal label "First Strike Records" out of Walnut Creek. This tape sounded better than the official release. Over the intervening years I made a rip of this tape and spread it around a bit on the internet, most folks hearing it happy to hear a better version. But this rip has flaws since it was just transferred on my home stereo system. _  
> _I noticed in the winter of 2015 that High Roller Records announced a repress of "Mark of the Beast" as coming soon. I immediately contacted them, sending Steffen and Patrick Engel my rip. Engel informed me of some audio errors in the transfer originating from my home equipment. In due course the original tape was sent off to Germany and what came back a few days later blew me away, simply this masterpiece restored to the finest version I had ever heard. I bow before the technical prowess of Engel, who made true one of the wishes of my life: that finally I could hear this classic in the best sounding version possible, restored with the original title and with corrected running order! _  
> _Anyway it is out now and and any Manilla-banger owes it to themselves to open their wallet as fast as possible and buy a copy!! Do not hesitate_

Coming back to the release itself, here we have 145 minutes of music!!! spread in two CDs. The first CD contains the original "lost" album remastered, while the second CD contains three songs from the 1979 Demo, a 5 song FM radio broadcast plus last but not least a home recording of **Flakes of Time**. Not many things needed to be said or written, in this album you will find a fine collection of Epic, psychedelic, progressive (proto) metal with a great atmosphere. For those adoring **Manilla Road** this is a must, for the rest I consider it a good start to introduce one's self to this unique band.
