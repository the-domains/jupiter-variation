_**Emilie Zoé- Dead-End Tape (2016)**_
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0847c838-b6ba-4624-b406-a6242095e453.jpg)

What a beautiful album this is! Imagine **PJ Harvey**(**To Bring You My Love **era) with an essence of **Portishead **melancholia, sometimes uptempo (**Little Liar**) but without getting dark or melodramatic. Just a voice, a guitar and some percussion in the background, singing over simple song structures...how is it possible that this has become my favourite listening for this summer's evenings? Well, I guess songs like**I Cried In My Beard**provide the answer.

**Emilie Zoé **is from Neuchâtel, Switzerland and this is her first full album (an E.P. titled**Empty**has preceded).
