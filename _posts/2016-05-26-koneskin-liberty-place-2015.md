**_Koneskin - Liberty Place (2015)_**

There's so much new music out there nowadays and there are so many ways for it to reach to the listener that a new band can really have hopes only if their music has this special "something" that can make someone stay without pressing the Skip button after listening to the first couple of minutes in Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Spotify or Youtube. This is exactly what happened to me with Italy's (coming from Torino) **Koneskin**. I discovered them via a tweet send to me and I fell immediately in love with their music.

**Koneskin** play a wonderful mixture of Post-Progressive Rock with a strong melancholic element consistently present in all their songs, just imagine **Pink Floyd** covering **Tool **songs and you can get a fairly accurate description of their music. Somehow, I have the feeling that **"Liberty Place"** is not their best output yet and I keep my hopes and expectations high for them. After all, not every band can write masterpieces like **"Apart".**

Please support the band and buy their music from here (I already did) :
