**Act Up Trio - Act Up (2013)**

**Act Up Trio**come from Thessaloniki, Greece with the three members consisting the group having a long and significant history in the local and European Jazz scenes. 

Their only release so far is**Act Up**7-inch which was recorded live in the**Royal Alzheimer Hall**studios of Epanomi, Greece during January of 2013 and was subsequently released in July of the same year. It consists of two songs, original composition**Yedi Kule**(taking its name from the Ottoman era prison located in Thessaloniki) and**Reference to Soropis**which is an improvisation based on the greek-rebetiko era song**O Soropis**initially performed by**Kostas Roukounas**in 1936\.

Well, the key word here is improvisation. Carrying an obvious (and of course strong) Jazz background, the trio lets the performances evolve and expand freely reaching to a final outcome that several times touches the limits of punk (one observant enough will even notice the word punk in the tag area of group's**Bandcamp**page).**Act Up Trio**are definitely punk in the way they approach their art and me being brave (and cliche) enough, I would name them Greece's answer to**John Zorn.**

If I could find only one fault in**Act Up Trio**, that would be the limited display of their craft during the 6 years of their existence (they were established in 2010) with this 7-inch being their only release. However all three members are over-productive with their other bands and music projects (one can easily access information about these in bands webpage).
