# **Swans & Anna von Hausswolff - Kaserne Basel \*Musik\*, 28 October 2016**

After I arrived in Kaserne I headed straight to the bar in order to buy myself a beer. On the bench, I immediately noticed the usual box with the earplugs and an ironic smile appeared on my face (for those not familiar, in Switzerland the volume of club and live concert music is regulated by law to 99 db and whenever needed - like in Heavy Metal concerts or gigs like **Swans** - the concert promoter is obliged to supply free earplugs to the audience). "I think you will need them tonight", the barman said to me and he continued: "I watched their soundcheck and they are loud...really, really loud". For a moment I wanted to start telling him stories about the infamous **Swans** performances of the 80's, where the music volume was reaching to 140 db and usually had to be stopped after intervention from the Police but I decided that I am too bored to start such a discussion in German, I just smiled at him, took a pair of fancy, fluorescent ones from the box and moved in front of the stage.

**Anna von Hausswolff** made her appearance sharply at 21:00, together with the two musicians who accompany her during this tour. After some initial moments of preparation, the lights went down and for the next 40 minutes we surrendered to her dramatic drone sounds which at certain moments were reaching to ferocious Black Metal scales. Seeing her on stage, I could not stop myself from thinking that she is the type of cool girl who we all wished once to have as a friend. Pretty enough to make a career as a pop star but in the same moment intelligent and with a great taste in music, capable of spending endless hours discussing things like records, books and movies.

Opening for a band like **Swans** is a big task but I have to say that night **Anna von Hausswollf** with her breathtaking performance, fulfilled it with absolute success. At the end, she wished to all of us goodbye and with an innocent and adorable smile (which reminded nothing of the girl who was maniacally head banging at the stage of Kaserne during the previous 40 minutes) left the stage.

**Swans** arrived at stage at 22:30 and **Michael Gira** firstly asked to turn on the volume of the lights enough so that he is able to see us. Immediately after, he turned his back to the audience and for the next 50 minutes he performed the role of the conductor by coordinating the rest of The **Swans** during the repeating but never escalating musical phrases of **The Knot **(a composition firstly presented during this tour and which is based on **No Words/No Thoughts** from **My Father Will Guide Me Up A Rope To The Sky**). For the next two hours **Swans** delivered a show based mainly on their last two records plus two "unknown" compositions. The sound of **Swans** in record is tamed but live resembles an absolute beast. This was helped by the volume which was loud (at a certain moment I put my back on the wall and I could feel the whole building - a 19th century military barracks- vibrating). I intentionally moved next to the sound console as I wanted to see the actual level in the monitors but it only showed a "disappointing" 110 db - surely not even being close to the infamous 140s of the past.

Looking at the audience (who by the way were mostly French) head banging, being literally in trance, I started wondering what **Michael Gira** of the 80's would have to say about it. Well, the times have changed and even he admits during his interviews that he is a different person now and I think that somehow it is mostly fair to acknowledge that the kids who listen to bands that were inspired by **Swans** (like **Neurosis, Isis, Cult of Luna** etc) are now his new audience during this second **Swans** incarnation. Seeing people with **Mercyful Fate** and **Dead Congregation** t-shirts next to hipsters made me think that Heavy Metal is finally taking its revenge by being the blood donor of Alternative Rock.

**Swans**, definitely delivered the goods that night, giving one of the most loud and extreme performances that were ever held in Basel. If this is really their last tour, then this was a proper and honourable goodbye. As **Michel Gira** said in the end, "See you probably some other time"...hopefully yes...

**Swans **Setlist:

* The Knot
* Screen Shot
* Cloud of Forgetting
* Cloud of Unknowing
* The Man Who Refused to Be Unhappy
* The Glowing Man
