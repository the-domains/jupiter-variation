_**Jagernaut - Split with Agamemnon Project (2016)**_
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg)

**Jagernaut** are coming from Athens, Greece and as you may have probably understood from the split cover, they play ultra-fast political grindcore in the vein of bands like **Agathocles**. Metal Influences can be still identified (especially by those who are native Greek speakers and can read the song titles which are a clever tribute to **Carcass** - but do not expect to listen anything like **Necroticism** here though...). This is their 4th official release (1 demo cassette and two other splits with **Terlarang** and **Zvarna** respectively have preceded). Following the genre's ethos this comes to 50 hand made CDr and is totally worthy of your time and money. Top notch release.
