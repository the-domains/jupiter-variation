**_Natvre's - Wrath (2016)_**

_Emerging from Thessaloniki Greece, but sounding impressively Scandinavian, **Natvre's **deliver a masterpiece of cold and grim BlackMetal(strong hardcore/crust influences are more than apparent - and welcome of course)...This is one of the strongest candidates for 2016's Black Metal album of the year..._
