**_Nine Inch Nails with David Bowie - Back In Anger (2016)_**

Truth is that I am a big **Nine Inch Nails** fan and completist so I would purchase this CD even if it was the biggest rip-off, cash-in, scam or whatever else of all times. Well, goods news are that it is NOT. But let's take the things from the beginning.

Back in 1995, **David Bowie** had lost all his appetite for touring. Convinced by Sony to do some provisional shows for **Outside**, he decided to take a more radical approach in order to make his concerts more creatively challenging. He hired a new rhythm section, compiled a setlist which mostly consisted of songs not having been released yet (also leaving out his glam-era standards) and most importantly **Bowie** decided to choose as an opening act **Nine Inch Nails **who by that time were already considered the most popular "Industrial" band in US (remember this was just after **"The Downward Spiral" **with **"Closer" **on heavy rotation by MTV). That worked perfectly for both. **Bowie** found the way to keep his interest in performing live and **Reznor** took inspiration from a (then) 48 year **Bowie** who was refusing to settle in his past glory. The idea was unique, shows would start with **NIN**, there would be no **NIN** encore, then **Bowie** would join **NIN **on stage and finally **NIN** would depart leaving **Reznor** with **Bowie** and his band. Oh boy, wish I was there...

This double-CD (containing an amazing amount of 152 minutes of music) captures entirely one of these performances, held at The Riverport Amphiteatre in St Louis, Missouri, on 11th October 1995 and being originally broadcasted by a local radio station.

The sound quality is great, though not flawless as some background noises or distortions can be heard here and there, but one can easily overlook this as we are talking about a document that captures a piece of rock history. There are so many things to discover in this recording. From **Hurt** sung by **Bowie** himself (and yes he is better than **Johnny Cash**) till the reinvention of **"The Man Who Sold The World"** (**Nirvana's** version was released some months before so I am sure that Bowie decided to claim back his song by reconstructing/recreating it). It is only a pity that it was **Bowie's **passing that made it possible for this CD to be released. 

This is not be missed.
