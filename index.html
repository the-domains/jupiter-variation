(2016)</span></span></h2></div><!-- react-empty: 36 --><!-- react-empty: 37 --><!-- react-empty: 38 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="39"><p>As someone who was born in the 70s, started listening to metal in the mid 80s (and in other words has lived throughout the “golden-era” of traditional heavy metal), I have a very clear view why bands like <strong>Manilla Road</strong> (or <strong>Warlord </strong>- but that’s another story) never managed to access big audiences during their time. To my humble opinion there have been two main reasons for this (and none of them was related to their skills or the quality of their material) :</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="40"><p>One, was the arrogant snobbism of the music press (especially in U.K.) where anything that their small minds could not comprehend was immediately intimidated. <strong>Kerrang</strong> once named <strong>Manilla Road</strong> as “the world’s ugliest band” while in one of “<strong>The Courts of Chaos</strong>” (last album before their split between 1992-1994) reviews (I think it was in <strong>Kerrang</strong> again) it was mentioned that even if the album was the last piece of toilet paper on earth, the journalist (whose name I do not currently recall) would not bother to wipe his ass with it…those were the times…</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="41"><p>Second (and most enraging reason) was the idiotic “True metal” elitism in countries like Greece which was always trying to keep bands like <strong>Manilla Road</strong> away from the masses and make them relevant only for the “initiated” and chosen ones. This started as a defence mechanism against the rise of Thrash metal at that time (when every release carrying the Roadrunner/Roadracer label was selling like warm bread) and ended up to a shitload of obscure vinyl records (which most of them were shit anyway) being sold overpriced in the Sunday flea markets.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="42"><p>I was familiar with the material of “<strong>Dreams of Eschaton</strong>” thanks (sic) to the self titled 1999 bootleg given for free with an issue of the Greek <strong>Metal Invader </strong>magazine (without the band knowing of course)…yes, magazines giving away bootlegs - once again, those were the times…nonetheless, the sound quality in this official rerelease is light years far away better. Some words about the background behind this release copied from the <strong>Nuclear War Now Productions</strong> forum (<a href="http://www.nwnprod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nwnprod.com</a>) :</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="43"><blockquote><p><em>Back in the mid 90's I first heard of the unreleased Manilla Road album from 1981, recorded between “Invasion” and “Metal”. Over several years I managed to get a couple of different dubs of this material through a variety of sources, hoping to find the best sounding version. At the time John Perez was spreading around one of the better copies out there. It boggled the mind that such a masterpiece was unreleased. </em><br><em>Anyway in 2002 this material was finally officially released as “Mark of the Beast”. I was very happy to see it. Sometime before that I had acquired a cassette that originated from Mark Shelton, it came from the archive of one of the owners of 80's metal label “First Strike Records” out of Walnut Creek. This tape sounded better than the official release. Over the intervening years I made a rip of this tape and spread it around a bit on the internet, most folks hearing it happy to hear a better version. But this rip has flaws since it was just transferred on my home stereo system. </em><br><em>I noticed in the winter of 2015 that High Roller Records announced a repress of “Mark of the Beast” as coming soon. I immediately contacted them, sending Steffen and Patrick Engel my rip. Engel informed me of some audio errors in the transfer originating from my home equipment. In due course the original tape was sent off to Germany and what came back a few days later blew me away, simply this masterpiece restored to the finest version I had ever heard. I bow before the technical prowess of Engel, who made true one of the wishes of my life: that finally I could hear this classic in the best sounding version possible, restored with the original title and with corrected running order! </em><br><em>Anyway it is out now and and any Manilla-banger owes it to themselves to open their wallet as fast as possible and buy a copy!! Do not hesitate</em></p></blockquote></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="44"><p>Coming back to the release itself, here we have 145 minutes of music!!! spread in two CDs. The first CD contains the original “lost” album remastered, while the second CD contains three songs from the 1979 Demo, a 5 song FM radio broadcast plus last but not least a home recording of <strong>Flakes of Time</strong>. Not many things needed to be said or written, in this album you will find a fine collection of Epic, psychedelic, progressive (proto) metal with a great atmosphere. For those adoring <strong>Manilla Road</strong> this is a must, for the rest I consider it a good start to introduce one’s self to this unique band.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="45"><p><a href="http://www.manillaroad.net/">www.manillaroad.net</a></p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-8990182f-8b2e-4653-bf9d-11789de17191" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="46"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="47"><p><em><strong>Natvre's - Wrath (2016)</strong></em></p><picture>

</picture><p>Nearly halfway 2016 and I have already found my first serious candidate for this year's best Black Metal album. <strong>Natvre's </strong>are coming from Greece but honestly do not expect to hear anything like <strong>Rotting Christ</strong> or <strong>Varathron</strong>    here. What you are going to experience instead, is one of the best Norwegian Black Metal records that never came out of Norway. <strong>Natvre's</strong> get their influences from bands like <strong>Burzum</strong> (minus the politics) and <strong>Darkthrone</strong>    (plus better aesthetics) and what really makes them standout is the way that they have digested and finally express these influences in their final artistic outcome. I chose the term "artistic" very carefully here but art is something that is supposed
    to create sentiments and feelings to people and judging by the chill I get in my spine every time I listen to the eight and half minutes of <strong>Hinterland </strong>we are definitely talking about art in this case.</p><p>Initially released in 100 copies in a beautiful digipack (the aesthetics I wrote about earlier) <strong>Wrath</strong> can be acquired by contacting the band in one of the following ways :</p><p>Twitter:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/natvres_band">twitter.com/natvres_band</a></p><p>Facebook:</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/natvres/">www.facebook.com/natvres/</a></p><p>Soundcloud:</p><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/natvres">soundcloud.com/natvres</a></p><p>Youtube:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FjiZdfVS2U">www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FjiZdfVS2U</a></p><p>Bandcamp:</p><p><a href="http://natvresbm.bandcamp.com/releases">http://natvresbm.bandcamp.com/releases</a></p><p>High chances are that this masterpiece is already sold out.

</picture><p>In anticipation of their new album (out on July 29 via <strong>Relapse</strong>), <strong>Ringworm</strong> release this special split 7-inch with Jazz-noise super-group <strong>Brain Tentacles</strong>. As anyone can easily understand from the cover,
    here we have two cover versions (<strong>Venom</strong> and <strong>Celtic Frost </strong>respectivelyone for each band) plus 3 original songs.</p><p><strong>Ringworm </strong>performancecomes as no surprise, the short (under two minutes) <strong>Destroy or Create</strong> and <strong>Venom's Poison</strong> are delivered in the usual, well known, high quality, blasting style that the band never fails
    to offer. However, the highlight of this split single is <strong>Brain Tentacles</strong>. Bypassing their interpretation of <strong>Celtic Frost's Innocence and Wrath</strong>, it is in the other two songs of this single (original compositions <strong>Kingda Ka</strong>    and <strong>The Spoiler</strong>) where they really rise and shine. Their mixture of Jazz, Grindcore and Noise brings only one name in mind...<strong>John Zorn's Naked City </strong>andafterhaving a more thorough look in the names of the members of
    this super group, you are soon left without doubts regarding their influences, their aesthetics and the expected quality of the result...drummer Dave Witte (<strong>Municipal Waste</strong>, <strong>Discordance Axis</strong>), saxophonist Bruce Lamont
    (<strong>Corrections House</strong>, <strong>Yakuza</strong>) and bassist Aaron Dallison (from the criminally underrated <strong>Keelhaul</strong>)...with such a roaster how can the result fail...6,66 $ are nothing compared to the real value of this

</picture><p><strong>Sumac </strong>have returned and their second release, <strong>What One Becomes</strong>, is heavier and darker than ever! Album beginner, <strong>Image of Control</strong>, sets pretty much the expectations starting with 4 minutes of monotonous
    cacophony until the voice of <strong>Aaron Turner</strong> kicks in and transforms the noise into a stunning composition. With none of its 5 songs being below 9 minutes, <strong>What One Becomes</strong> continues in the same manner. Tribal rhythms
    (<strong>Blackout</strong>), slow tempos, repeated patterns, lack of melodies, no post-atmospheric parts, absolutely nothing at all that could make this record an easy listening. Just 60 minute of solid heaviness. For sure this is an album that needs
    time to evolve and many listens for one to scratch behind the surface of heaviness and darkness and uncover the hidden beauty. To my own ears, <strong>Sumac's</strong> delivery has more in common with <strong>Swans</strong> than <strong>Isis</strong>.
    Someone may disagree but since when listening to music has become a non-personal matter? Starting with <strong>Oceanic</strong>, <strong>Aaron Turner's</strong> art has accompanied some of the darkest moments of my life. If there is one thing that
    I wish for, is to have more of his art and less of the dark moments in my life.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SUMACBAND" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/SUMACBAND</a></p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fbandcamp.com%2FEmbeddedPlayer%2Fv%3D2%2Falbum%3D325352233%2Fsize%3Dlarge%2Flinkcol%3D0084B4%2Fnotracklist%3Dtrue%2Ftwittercard%3Dtrue%2F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsumac.bandcamp.com%2F&image=https%3A%2F%2Ff4.bcbits.com%2Fimg%2Fa0219894529_5.jpg&key=b7d04c9b404c499eba89ee7072e1c4f7&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=bandcamp"

</picture><p>My biggest problem with political grindcore is that by the moment you drop the needle on the turntable, turn your back, walk to the fridge to grab a beer, you have to immediately return and change the record side. Of course, someone could counter-suggest
    that if a band is able to write single minute dynamites that are able to transfer the message clearly and straightforward then there is no reason to consume time and energy in repeated choruses and useless solos...and you know, in the case of <strong>Stheno</strong>    and <strong>World Downfall</strong> this statement would be absolutely right. 1 7inch, 2 sides, 6 songs, approximately 8 minutes of magnificent ultra fast, political grindcore.</p><p>Buy from here :</p><p><a href="https://everydayhate.bandcamp.com/album/edh073-split-7ep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everydayhate.bandcamp.com/album/edh073-split-7ep</a></p><p><a href="http://stheno.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stheno.bandcamp.com</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sthenoband/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/Sthenoband</a></p><p><a href="http://worlddownfall.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worlddownfall.bandcamp.com</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/worlddownfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/worlddownfall</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="60"><!-- react-empty: 61 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-88624fb1-5146-4334-a56c-dd2bdce884c9" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="62"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="63"><p><em><strong>Master's Hammer - Formulae (2016)</strong></em></p><picture>

</picture><p>If there is one characterisation that can perfectly fit to bands like<strong>Master's Hammer</strong>is artistic integrity. Having built a cult name during the second wave of Black Metal era in the 90's with albums like <strong>Ritual</strong>(1991) or<strong>Jilemnický Okultista</strong>(1993),
    they decided to cease status after the disappointment (at least in its initial receptions) that<strong>Šlágry</strong>(1995) was. Emerging again in 2009 with (the great)<strong>Mantras</strong>they have since then followed their own, totally independent
    (they release their own material themselves) and in the same time honest way.<strong>Master's Hammer</strong>could have very easily attempted to offer a<strong>Ritual</strong>or a<strong>Jilemnický Okultistapart 2</strong>, having it released it through
    a major German heavy metal record company and have the 20 year olds who did not live the past eras praise them as vberkvlt...but they did not...instead, they decided to remain in obscurity, record and release their experimental material they way they
    want it and keep their artistic vision pure and unaffected.</p><p><strong>Formulae</strong>is their 4th full length after their reformation (<strong>Mantras</strong>in2009,<strong>Vracejte konve na místo</strong>in 2012,<strong>Vagus Vetus</strong>in2014 plus some split singles and demo rereleases in between) and my
    opinion is that in this album<strong>Master's Hammer</strong>have finally managed to perfect the formula for crafting their ritualistic mixture of Black Metal and Electronic music that was firstly attempted during<strong>Šlágry</strong>.</p><p>The record kicks off perfectly with<strong>Den Nicoty</strong>which is speedy and majestic metal while second song<strong>Maso Z Kosmu</strong>is more of an dark industrial anthem. Both songs demonstrate perfectly the direction that the album is going
    to follow combining perfectly electronic elements (<strong>Votava</strong>,<strong>Podburka</strong>), Industrial (<strong>Arachnid, Vsem Jebne, Biologicke Hodini, DMT)</strong>, Metal (<strong>Shy Gecko</strong>with the amazingly addictive female
    refrain,<strong>Jazyky, Durga Chee Pit, Ukolebavka</strong>), oriental and indian influenced (part of the album was written in India) interludes (<strong>Phenakistoscope, Ruralni Dobro, Aya)</strong>. Add to all the above theamazing way that the Czech
    language contributes to the build up of the overall atmosphere and then you have one of the most trve albums of the year. Someone may ask if this is still Black Metal but who the fuck cares...This is honest as hell...</p><p>Please contact/purchase here :</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MastersHammerOfficial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/MastersHammerOfficial</a></p><p><a href="http://www.mastershammer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mastershammer.com</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="64"><!-- react-empty: 65 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-d7c38db0-8a07-4cf8-935b-9776a2ad0028" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="66"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="67"><p><em><strong>Koneskin - Liberty Place (2015)</strong></em></p><picture>

</picture><p>There's so much new music out there nowadays and there are so many ways for it to reach to the listener that a new band can really have hopes only if their music has this special "something" that can make someone stay without pressing the Skip button
    after listening to the first couple of minutes in Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Spotify or Youtube. This is exactly what happened to me with Italy's (coming from Torino)<strong>Koneskin</strong>. I discovered them via a tweet send to me and I fell immediately
    in love with their music.</p><p><strong>Koneskin</strong>play a wonderful mixture of Post-Progressive Rock with a strong melancholic element consistently present in all their songs, just imagine<strong>Pink Floyd</strong>covering<strong>Tool</strong>songs and you can get a fairly accurate
    description of their music. Somehow, I have the feeling that<strong>"Liberty Place"</strong>is not their best output yet and I keep my hopes and expectations high for them.

</picture><p>Truth is that I am a big<strong>Nine Inch Nails </strong>fan and completist so I would purchase this CD even if it was the biggest rip-off, cash-in, scam or whatever else of all times. Well, goods news are that it is NOT. But let's take the things from
    the beginning.</p><p>Back in 1995,<strong>David Bowie</strong>had lost all his appetite for touring. Convinced by Sony to do some provisional shows for<strong>Outside</strong>, he decided to take a more radical approach in order to make his concerts more creatively challenging.
    He hired a new rhythm section, compiled a setlist which mostly consisted of songs not having been released yet (also leaving out his glam-era standards) and most importantly<strong>Bowie</strong>decided to choose as an opening act<strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong>who
    by that time were already considered the most popular "Industrial" band in US (remember this was just after<strong>"The Downward Spiral"</strong>with<strong>"Closer"</strong>on heavy rotation by MTV). That worked perfectly for both.<strong>Bowie</strong>found
    the way to keep his interest in performing live and<strong>Reznor</strong>took inspiration from a (then) 48 year<strong>Bowie</strong>who was refusing to settle in his past glory. The idea was unique, shows would start with<strong>NIN</strong>, there
    would be no<strong>NIN</strong>encore, then<strong>Bowie</strong>would join<strong>NIN</strong>on stage and finally<strong>NIN</strong>would depart leaving<strong>Reznor</strong>with<strong>Bowie</strong>and his band. Oh boy, wish I was there...</p><p>This double-CD (containing an amazing amount of 152 minutes of music) captures entirely one of these performances, held at The Riverport Amphiteatre in St Louis, Missouri, on 11th October 1995 and being originally broadcasted by a local radio station.</p><p>The sound quality is great, though not flawless as some background noises or distortions can be heard here and there, but one can easily overlook this as we are talking about a document that captures a piece of rock history. There are so many things to
    discover in this recording. From<strong>Hurt</strong>sung by<strong>Bowie</strong>himself (and yes he is better than<strong>Johnny Cash</strong>) till the reinvention of<strong>"The Man Who Sold The World"</strong>(<strong>Nirvana's</strong>version
    was released some months before so I am sure that Bowie decided to claim back his song by reconstructing/recreating it). It is only a pity that it was<strong>Bowie's</strong>passing that made it possible for this CD to be released.</p><p>This is not be missed.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="76"><!-- react-empty: 77 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumnLarge-679a29ce-e9b4-4f4c-a31d-25adda666fdb" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0  text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="78"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="79"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-33p w-100p ms-w-33p" data-reactid="80"><a class=" " href="autokrator-the-obedience-to-authority-2016" data-reactid="81"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="82"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="83"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/821cb31af32648f462f10edd429fe2b1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F46693d6f-6ebb-42c2-937e-80634c31a9af.jpg&amp;width=700" style="object-position:97.85714285714285% 79.28571428571428%;" data-reactid="84"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/821cb31af32648f462f10edd429fe2b1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F46693d6f-6ebb-42c2-937e-80634c31a9af.jpg&amp;width=700" style="object-position:97.85714285714285% 79.28571428571428%;" data-reactid="85"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/821cb31af32648f462f10edd429fe2b1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F46693d6f-6ebb-42c2-937e-80634c31a9af.jpg&amp;width=700" style="object-position:97.85714285714285% 79.28571428571428%;" data-reactid="86"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/35bbfe8a1ef1a54b40ead0be122ab0eb/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F46693d6f-6ebb-42c2-937e-80634c31a9af.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:97.85714285714285% 79.28571428571428%;" data-reactid="87"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="700" data-height="700" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/821cb31af32648f462f10edd429fe2b1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F46693d6f-6ebb-42c2-937e-80634c31a9af.jpg&amp;width=700" style="object-position:97.85714285714285% 79.28571428571428%;" data-reactid="88"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column ms-min-w-480px col-2 col-gap-s p-2 ms-p-h-8 ms-p-v-3 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-66p color-title" data-reactid="89"><!-- react-empty: 90 --><!-- react-empty: 91 --><!-- react-empty: 92 --><!-- react-empty: 93 --><!-- react-empty: 94 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="95"><p><em><strong>Autokrator - The Obedience to Authority (2016)</strong></em></p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="96"><p>This is undoubtedly one of the most extreme albums that I have ever heard. <strong>Autokrator</strong> (means Emperor in Greek) are coming from France and although their 2015 self-named first album has gathered ambiguous reviews, here in their second attempt they continue by following the exact same artistic direction. Hyper speed drumming, absolute no groove, no melodies, no solos, only a cold, long, monotonous, seething, sludge, filthy, asphyxiating death metal . <strong>Autokrator's</strong> sound is raw, violent, rude and indiscrete but in the same time addictively attractive.

Gaining quickly a viral status - granting them access to big television networks like NBC, ABC, CNN, Comedy Central, Fuse, appearance slots in big festivals like Coachella (becoming the youngest group ever to perform there), SxSW, Vans Warped Tour and support gigs to Guns 'n Roses, Mötörhead, Marilyn Manson, Queens of the Stone Age among others - they signed a $1.8 Million deal with Sony Music Entertainment out of which they successfully managed to negotiate their exit in 2015. After all the ups and downs they have finally managed to release their first full album <strong>Chaos </strong>in July 2016 and the first immediate question that comes to mind, is the obvious one : Does it really stand up to the hype ?</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="118"><p>The answer is YES. The musicianship in <strong>Chaos</strong> is great, the songs have catchy hooks and melodies (like in my personal favourite <strong>Made of Stone</strong>), the guitar riffs are exquisite ( just listen to the guitar work in <strong>Monster </strong>or in<strong> Faywb</strong>) and generally one can easily say that the band composes and plays music with the self-confidence of scene veterans. The only remark that I would dare to make is that in some points, the attempt to incorporate as many of their influences as possible is apparent and this disorientates the final result. Nevertheless, to correct this is only a matter of experience and digestion (of their influences) and I honestly hope that <strong>Unlocking the Truth</strong> stay long united as a band in order to achieve this. Doing my math, they must be now 15-16 years old so the music world has a lot to expect from them. All in all, a refreshing album.</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="119"><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/UTTBand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/UTTBand</a></p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="120"><p><a href="http://unlockingthetruthband.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unlockingthetruthband.com</a></p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-c5cad1e6-79e5-4b42-bf9b-f5b5cba9d80a" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="121"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="122"><p><em><strong>Sülfür Ensemble - I (4 Songs About Dystopia, Satan, Ghouls &amp; Marilyn Monroe) 2016</strong></em></p><picture>

</picture><p><strong>Sülfür Ensemble </strong>are a 4 piece coming from Istanbul Turkey (the cursed land as they proclaim) and they play fuzzy Doom 'n Roll. <strong>I (4 Songs About Dystopia, Satan, Ghouls &amp; Marilyn Monroe)</strong> is their first output (for
    the moment available only in digital platforms like <strong>Bandcamp </strong>and <strong>Soundcloud</strong> even though plans exist for a physical release in the future). The title of the E.P. is absolutely explanatory about the content of the songs
    :</p><p><strong> Daily Hate </strong>: E.P. opener is sooooo heavy. It starts slowly having a fuzzy guitar sound that would make <strong>Tony Iommi</strong> proud but just around 4:58 the song explodes. What a great start!</p><p><strong>Plea</strong> : This is the album highlight. Same approach as the first song but obviously much more worked as a composition. Just listen to the guitar work in this piece! Candidate for one of this year's best songs. Non Serviam!</p><p><strong>Karaçor</strong> : I love the "dirtiness" in the vocals here and the way that this song ends (the combination of the guitar feedback and the repetitive screaming "Karaçor" nails it).</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong> : The grooviest of the 4 songs, has a more punkish approach and in combination with the title and the lyrical content it brought to my mind bands like Misfits and Cathedral. This would be the single of the record.</p><p>Overall, <strong>I</strong> is a promising release which sets the standards high and "prepares" our appetite for a full album.</p><p><strong><a href="http://sulfurensemble.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sulfurensemble.bandcamp.com</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/sulfurensemble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundcloud.com/sulfurensemble</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sulfurensemble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/sulfurensemble</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/sulfurensemble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter.com/sulfurensemble</a></strong></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="123"><!-- react-empty: 124 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumnLarge-91a41c91-d3a2-4bdb-b4ab-10490b2d282e" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0  text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="125"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="126"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-33p w-100p ms-w-33p" data-reactid="127"><a class=" " href="jagernaut-split-with-agamemnon-project-2016" data-reactid="128"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="129"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="130"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/431095dde97c109895890267d053c047/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:91.89453125% 27.44140625%;" data-reactid="131"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/431095dde97c109895890267d053c047/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:91.89453125% 27.44140625%;" data-reactid="132"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/49338d985c4b225f57b71b44229a398b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:91.89453125% 27.44140625%;" data-reactid="133"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0b23c5222f5d1beea8dca4c697c01e2c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:91.89453125% 27.44140625%;" data-reactid="134"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1200" data-height="1200" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/431095dde97c109895890267d053c047/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:91.89453125% 27.44140625%;" data-reactid="135"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column ms-min-w-480px col-2 col-gap-s p-2 ms-p-h-8 ms-p-v-3 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-66p color-title" data-reactid="136"><!-- react-empty: 137 --><!-- react-empty: 138 --><!-- react-empty: 139 --><!-- react-empty: 140 --><!-- react-empty: 141 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="142"><p><em><strong>Jagernaut - Split with Agamemnon Project (2016)</strong></em></p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="143"><p><strong>Jagernaut</strong> are coming from Athens, Greece and as you may have probably understood from the split cover, they play ultra-fast political grindcore in the vein of bands like <strong>Agathocles</strong>.

Top notch release.</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="144"><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Jagernautwar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/Jagernautwar</a></p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="145"><p><a href="https://jagernaut.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jagernaut.wordpress.com</a></p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="146"><p><a href="https://jagernaut.bandcamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jagernaut.bandcamp.com</a></p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-6521bf14-c2a2-4506-a1b9-521e9cd1d110" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="147"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="148"><p><em><strong>Zatokrev - Silk Spiders Underwater...

</picture><p><strong>Zatokrev </strong>formed in 2002 in Basel, Switzerland. According to their Facebook page, they play "Apocalypse Metal" (sic), nevertheless I would say that if there is one band that has defined the sound and the aesthetics of them, this is<strong>Neurosis</strong>.<strong>Silk Spiders Uderwater...</strong>is
    their 4th official release (they have also released a split CD with<strong>Vancouver</strong>) and is the first of two concept albums with the second one, named<strong>…Bring Mirrors To The Surface,</strong>scheduledto be released somewhere between
    2016 and 2017.</p><p>As you may have already understood,<strong>Zatokrev</strong>play sludge metal BUT there are certain elements in this album that put them in the first league of the genre and -at least to my humble opinion- place them amongst equals next to bands like<strong>Cult Of Luna.</strong>The
    first one is the production (done in Geneva guaranteeing the presence of the famous Swiss quality in doing things) and which allows the dynamics and the multiple dimensions of the songs to become clear to the listener. The second one is the excellent
    musicianship which helps the ideas behind the compositions to evolve freely. Having these aces up their sleeves, it is easy for<strong>Zatokrev</strong>to rise and shine in<strong>Silk Spiders Underwater...</strong>Songs like<strong>Bleeding Island</strong>or<strong>Brick In The Sky</strong>,
    which is the highlight of the CD, have rightfully conquered a place in my sludge/post metal playlists next to masterpieces like<strong>Carry</strong>by<strong>Isis, Stones From the Sky</strong>by<strong>Neurosis</strong>and most recently<strong>Cygnus</strong>by<strong>Cult Of Luna.</strong></p><p><strong>Silk Spiders Underwater...</strong>is(was) one of the best albums of 2015 - it's too bad that I only discovered it in 2016...</p><p>More info/contacts about<strong>Zatokrev</strong>can be found/made in/through the following links :</p><p>Official Site :</p><p><a href="http://www.zatokrev.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zatokrev.com</a></p><p>Facebook :</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ZATOKREV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/ZATOKREV</a></p><p>Bandcamp :</p><p><a href="https://zatokrev.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zatokrev.bandcamp.com</a></p><p>Soundcloud :</p><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/zatokrev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundcloud.com/zatokrev</a></p><p>Twitter:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/zatokrev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter.com/zatokrev</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="149"><!-- react-empty: 150 --></div></section><section id="section-LoadMoreWButton-next-page-item-0" class="Section Section--loadmore Section--components-1 color-title p-h-1 ls-p-h-2 p-v-4 color-bg  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="151"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="152"><button class="color-box-pop pos-a circle w-4rem h-4rem center-hv m-0 cur-p" data-reactid="153"><span class="center-hv pos-a w-2rem h-2rem" data-reactid="154"><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" enable-background="new 384.4 271.2 26.4 26.8" xml:space="preserve"><path class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" d="M397.8,298c-7.4,0-13.4-6-13.4-13.4s6-13.4,13.4-13.4c5.3,0,10.2,3.2,12.3,8l-2.8,1.2  c-1.7-3.8-5.4-6.2-9.5-6.2c-5.7,0-10.4,4.7-10.4,10.4s4.7,10.4,10.4,10.4c4.6,0,8.7-3.1,10-7.5l2.9,0.8 C409.1,294,403.8,298,397.8,298z"/><polyline class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" points="410.9,274.4 410.9,281.2 404.1,281.2 "/><rect class="color-box-pop-text" x="396.6" y="280" fill="#F05525" width="2" height="9.2"/><rect x="393" y="283.6" class="color-box-pop-text" fill="#F05525" width="9.2" height="2"/></svg></span></button></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="155"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="156"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="157"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="158"><span data-reactid="159"><!-- react-empty: 160 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="161"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="162">Jupiter Variation</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="163"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="164"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="165"><div class="Link" data-reactid="166"><a data-reactid="167"></a></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>
