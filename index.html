<p><strong>Sumac </strong>have returned and their second release, <strong>What One Becomes</strong>, is heavier and darker than ever! Album beginner, <strong>Image of Control</strong>, sets pretty much the expectations starting with 4 minutes of monotonous cacophony until the voice of <strong>Aaron Turner</strong> kicks in and transforms the noise into a stunning composition. With none of its 5 songs being below 9 minutes, <strong>What One Becomes</strong> continues in the same manner. Tribal rhythms (<strong>Blackout</strong>), slow tempos, repeated patterns, lack of melodies, no post-atmospheric parts, absolutely nothing at all that could make this record an easy listening. Just 60 minute of solid heaviness. For sure this is an album that needs time to evolve and many listens for one to scratch behind the surface of heaviness and darkness and uncover the hidden beauty. To my own ears, <strong>Sumac's</strong> delivery has more in common with <strong>Swans</strong> than <strong>Isis</strong>. Someone may disagree but since when listening to music has become a non-personal matter? Starting with <strong>Oceanic</strong>, <strong>Aaron Turner's</strong> art has accompanied some of the darkest moments of my life. If there is one thing that I wish for, is to have more of his art and less of the dark moments in my life.</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/SUMACBAND</p><iframe

<p>If there is one characterisation that can perfectly fit to bands like<strong>Master's Hammer</strong>is artistic integrity. Having built a cult name during the second wave of Black Metal era in the 90's with albums like <strong>Ritual</strong>(1991) or<strong>Jilemnický Okultista</strong>(1993), they decided to cease status after the disappointment (at least in its initial receptions) that<strong>Šlágry</strong>(1995) was. Emerging again in 2009 with (the great)<strong>Mantras</strong>they have since then followed their own, totally independent (they release their own material themselves) and in the same time honest way.<strong>Master's Hammer</strong>could have very easily attempted to offer a<strong>Ritual</strong>or a<strong>Jilemnický Okultistapart 2</strong>, having it released it through a major German heavy metal record company and have the 20 year olds who did not live the past eras praise them as vberkvlt...but they did not...instead, they decided to remain in obscurity, record and release their experimental material they way they want it and keep their artistic vision pure and unaffected.</p><p><strong>Formulae</strong>is their 4th full length after their reformation (<strong>Mantras</strong>in2009,<strong>Vracejte konve na místo</strong>in 2012,<strong>Vagus Vetus</strong>in2014 plus some split singles and demo rereleases in between) and my opinion is that in this album<strong>Master's Hammer</strong>have finally managed to perfect the formula for crafting their ritualistic mixture of Black Metal and Electronic music that was firstly attempted during<strong>Šlágry</strong>.</p><p>The record kicks off perfectly with<strong>Den Nicoty</strong>which is speedy and majestic metal while second song<strong>Maso Z Kosmu</strong>is more of an dark industrial anthem. Both songs demonstrate perfectly the direction that the album is going to follow combining perfectly electronic elements (<strong>Votava</strong>,<strong>Podburka</strong>), Industrial (<strong>Arachnid, Vsem Jebne, Biologicke Hodini, DMT)</strong>, Metal (<strong>Shy Gecko</strong>with the amazingly addictive female refrain,<strong>Jazyky, Durga Chee Pit, Ukolebavka</strong>), oriental and indian influenced (part of the album was written in India) interludes (<strong>Phenakistoscope, Ruralni Dobro, Aya)</strong>. Add to all the above theamazing way that the Czech language contributes to the build up of the overall atmosphere and then you have one of the most trve albums of the year. Someone may ask if this is still Black Metal but who the fuck cares...This is honest as hell...</p><p>Please contact/purchase here :</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/MastersHammerOfficial/</p><p>http://www.mastershammer.com/</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="59"><!-- react-empty: 60 --></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fl-l fade-in  color-bg section-height-fullscreen text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="61"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="62"><p><em><strong>Koneskin - Liberty Place (2015)</strong></em></p><picture>

<p>There's so much new music out there nowadays and there are so many ways for it to reach to the listener that a new band can really have hopes only if their music has this special "something" that can make someone stay without pressing the Skip button after listening to the first couple of minutes in Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Spotify or Youtube. This is exactly what happened to me with Italy's (coming from Torino)<strong>Koneskin</strong>. I discovered them via a tweet send to me and I fell immediately in love with their music.</p><p><strong>Koneskin</strong>play a wonderful mixture of Post-Progressive Rock with a strong melancholic element consistently present in all their songs, just imagine<strong>Pink Floyd</strong>covering<strong>Tool</strong>songs and you can get a fairly accurate description of their music. Somehow, I have the feeling that<strong>"Liberty Place"</strong>is not their best output yet and I keep my hopes and expectations high for them. After all, not every band can write masterpieces like<strong>"Apart".</strong></p><p>Please support the band and buy their music from here (I already did)

<p>Truth is that I am a big<strong>Nine Inch Nails </strong>fan and completist so I would purchase this CD even if it was the biggest rip-off, cash-in, scam or whatever else of all times. Well, goods news are that it is NOT. But let's take the things from the beginning.</p><p>Back in 1995,<strong>David Bowie</strong>had lost all his appetite for touring. Convinced by Sony to do some provisional shows for<strong>Outside</strong>, he decided to take a more radical approach in order to make his concerts more creatively challenging. He hired a new rhythm section, compiled a setlist which mostly consisted of songs not having been released yet (also leaving out his glam-era standards) and most importantly<strong>Bowie</strong>decided to choose as an opening act<strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong>who by that time were already considered the most popular "Industrial" band in US (remember this was just after<strong>"The Downward Spiral"</strong>with<strong>"Closer"</strong>on heavy rotation by MTV). That worked perfectly for both.<strong>Bowie</strong>found the way to keep his interest in performing live and<strong>Reznor</strong>took inspiration from a (then) 48 year<strong>Bowie</strong>who was refusing to settle in his past glory. The idea was unique, shows would start with<strong>NIN</strong>, there would be no<strong>NIN</strong>encore, then<strong>Bowie</strong>would join<strong>NIN</strong>on stage and finally<strong>NIN</strong>would depart leaving<strong>Reznor</strong>with<strong>Bowie</strong>and his band. Oh boy, wish I was there...</p><p>This double-CD (containing an amazing amount of 152 minutes of music) captures entirely one of these performances, held at The Riverport Amphiteatre in St Louis, Missouri, on 11th October 1995 and being originally broadcasted by a local radio station.</p><p>The sound quality is great, though not flawless as some background noises or distortions can be heard here and there, but one can easily overlook this as we are talking about a document that captures a piece of rock history. There are so many things to discover in this recording. From<strong>Hurt</strong>sung by<strong>Bowie</strong>himself (and yes he is better than<strong>Johnny Cash</strong>) till the reinvention of<strong>"The Man Who Sold The World"</strong>(<strong>Nirvana's</strong>version was released some months before so I am sure that Bowie decided to claim back his song by reconstructing/recreating it). It is only a pity that it was<strong>Bowie's</strong>passing that made it possible for this CD to be released.</p><p>This is not be missed.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="107"><!-- react-empty: 108 --></div></section><section id="8" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="109"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="110"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ls-w-66p" data-reactid="111"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="112"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="113"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/821cb31af32648f462f10edd429fe2b1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F46693d6f-6ebb-42c2-937e-80634c31a9af.jpg&amp;width=700" style="object-position:97.85714285714285% 79.28571428571428%;" data-reactid="114"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/821cb31af32648f462f10edd429fe2b1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F46693d6f-6ebb-42c2-937e-80634c31a9af.jpg&amp;width=700" style="object-position:97.85714285714285% 79.28571428571428%;" data-reactid="115"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/821cb31af32648f462f10edd429fe2b1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F46693d6f-6ebb-42c2-937e-80634c31a9af.jpg&amp;width=700" style="object-position:97.85714285714285% 79.28571428571428%;" data-reactid="116"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/35bbfe8a1ef1a54b40ead0be122ab0eb/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F46693d6f-6ebb-42c2-937e-80634c31a9af.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:97.85714285714285% 79.28571428571428%;" data-reactid="117"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="700" data-height="700" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/821cb31af32648f462f10edd429fe2b1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F46693d6f-6ebb-42c2-937e-80634c31a9af.jpg&amp;width=700" style="object-position:97.85714285714285% 79.28571428571428%;" data-reactid="118"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-5 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="119"><!-- react-empty: 120 --><!-- react-empty: 121 --><!-- react-empty: 122 --><!-- react-empty: 123 --><!-- react-empty: 124 --><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="125"><p data-reactid="126">Autokrator - The Obedience to Authority (2016)</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="127"><p data-reactid="128">This is undoubtedly one of the most extreme albums that I have ever heard. Autokrator (means Emperor in Greek) are coming from France and although their 2015 self-named first album has gathered ambiguous reviews, here in their second attempt they continue by following the exact same artistic direction. Hyper speed drumming, absolute no groove, no melodies, no solos, only a cold, long, monotonous, seething, sludge, filthy, asphyxiating death metal . Autokrator&#x27;s sound is raw, violent, rude and indiscrete but in the same time addictively attractive. Never heard a more beautiful cacophony before.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="129"><p data-reactid="130">https://www.facebook.com/autokratormetal/</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="131"><p data-reactid="132">http://autokrator.bandcamp.com/</p></div></div></div></section><section id="10" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0  text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="133"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="134"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-33p w-100p ls-w-33p" data-reactid="135"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="136"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="137"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5d556bd029be652189862b87f9386863/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F35b1b234-8c64-44b0-baed-ec2332de572a.jpg&amp;width=600" style="object-position:68% 78%;" data-reactid="138"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5d556bd029be652189862b87f9386863/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F35b1b234-8c64-44b0-baed-ec2332de572a.jpg&amp;width=600" style="object-position:68% 78%;" data-reactid="139"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5d556bd029be652189862b87f9386863/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F35b1b234-8c64-44b0-baed-ec2332de572a.jpg&amp;width=600" style="object-position:68% 78%;" data-reactid="140"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/29c020d2f703a13ac7146eca77641fc7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F35b1b234-8c64-44b0-baed-ec2332de572a.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:68% 78%;" data-reactid="141"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="600" data-height="600" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5d556bd029be652189862b87f9386863/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F35b1b234-8c64-44b0-baed-ec2332de572a.jpg&amp;width=600" style="object-position:68% 78%;" data-reactid="142"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column ls-min-w-480px col-2 col-gap-s p-2 ls-p-h-8 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-66p color-title" data-reactid="143"><!-- react-empty: 144 --><!-- react-empty: 145 --><!-- react-empty: 146 --><!-- react-empty: 147 --><!-- react-empty: 148 --><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="149"><p data-reactid="150">Unlocking the Truth - Chaos (2016)</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="151"><p data-reactid="152"> Unlocking the Truth became an internet sensation in 2012, as the band of three 11 year olds who used to perform live in Times Square. Gaining quickly a viral status - granting them access to big television networks like NBC, ABC, CNN, Comedy Central, Fuse, appearance slots in big festivals like Coachella (becoming the youngest group ever to perform there), SxSW, Vans Warped Tour and support gigs to Guns &#x27;n Roses, Mötörhead, Marilyn Manson, Queens of the Stone Age among others - they signed a $1.8 Million deal with Sony Music Entertainment out of which they successfully managed to negotiate their exit in 2015. After all the ups and downs they have finally managed to release their first full album Chaos in July 2016 and the first immediate question that comes to mind, is the obvious one : Does it really stand up to the hype ?</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="153"><p data-reactid="154">The answer is YES. The musicianship in Chaos is great, the songs have catchy hooks and melodies (like in my personal favourite Made of Stone), the guitar riffs are exquisite ( just listen to the guitar work in Monster or in Faywb) and generally one can easily say that the band composes and plays music with the self-confidence of scene veterans. The only remark that I would dare to make is that in some points, the attempt to incorporate as many of their influences as possible is apparent and this disorientates the final result. Nevertheless, to correct this is only a matter of experience and digestion (of their influences) and I honestly hope that Unlocking the Truth stay long united as a band in order to achieve this. Doing my math, they must be now 15-16 years old so the music world has a lot to expect from them. All in all, a refreshing album.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="155"><p data-reactid="156">https://www.facebook.com/UTTBand/</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="157"><p data-reactid="158">http://unlockingthetruthband.com/</p></div></div></div></section><section id="11" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fl-l fade-in  color-bg section-height-fullscreen text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="159"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="160"><p><em><strong>Sülfür Ensemble - I (4 Songs About Dystopia, Satan, Ghouls &amp; Marilyn Monroe) 2016</strong></em></p><picture>

<p><strong>Sülfür Ensemble </strong>are a 4 piece coming from Istanbul Turkey (the cursed land as they proclaim) and they play fuzzy Doom 'n Roll. <strong>I (4 Songs About Dystopia, Satan, Ghouls &amp; Marilyn Monroe)</strong> is their first output (for the moment available only in digital platforms like <strong>Bandcamp </strong>and <strong>Soundcloud</strong> even though plans exist for a physical release in the future). The title of the E.P. is absolutely explanatory about the content of the songs :</p><p><strong> Daily Hate </strong>: E.P. opener is sooooo heavy. It starts slowly having a fuzzy guitar sound that would make <strong>Tony Iommi</strong> proud but just around 4:58 the song explodes. What a great start!</p><p><strong>Plea</strong> : This is the album highlight. Same approach as the first song but obviously much more worked as a composition. Just listen to the guitar work in this piece! Candidate for one of this year's best songs. Non Serviam!</p><p><strong>Karaçor</strong> : I love the "dirtiness" in the vocals here and the way that this song ends (the combination of the guitar feedback and the repetitive screaming "Karaçor" nails it).</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong> : The grooviest of the 4 songs, has a more punkish approach and in combination with the title and the lyrical content it brought to my mind bands like Misfits and Cathedral. This would be the single of the record.</p><p>Overall, <strong>I</strong> is a promising release which sets the standards high and "prepares" our appetite for a full album.</p><p><strong>http://sulfurensemble.bandcamp.com/</strong></p><p><strong>https://soundcloud.com/sulfurensemble/</strong></p><p><strong>https://www.facebook.com/sulfurensemble</strong></p><p><strong>https://twitter.com/sulfurensemble</strong></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="161"><!-- react-empty: 162 --></div></section><section id="12" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="163"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="164"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="165"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="166"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="167"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/431095dde97c109895890267d053c047/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:91.89453125% 27.44140625%;" data-reactid="168"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/431095dde97c109895890267d053c047/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:91.89453125% 27.44140625%;" data-reactid="169"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/49338d985c4b225f57b71b44229a398b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:91.89453125% 27.44140625%;" data-reactid="170"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0b23c5222f5d1beea8dca4c697c01e2c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:91.89453125% 27.44140625%;" data-reactid="171"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1200" data-height="1200" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/431095dde97c109895890267d053c047/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fcc5ae578-e27d-4bf1-b430-65c564242535.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:91.89453125% 27.44140625%;" data-reactid="172"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="173"><!-- react-empty: 174 --><!-- react-empty: 175 --><!-- react-empty: 176 --><!-- react-empty: 177 --><!-- react-empty: 178 --><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="179"><p data-reactid="180">Jagernaut - Split with Agamemnon Project (2016)</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="181"><p data-reactid="182">Jagernaut are coming from Athens, Greece and as you may have probably understood from the split cover, they play ultra-fast political grindcore in the vein of bands like Agathocles.

This is their 4th official release (1 demo cassette and two other splits with Terlarang and Zvarna respectively have preceded).

<p><strong>Zatokrev </strong>formed in 2002 in Basel, Switzerland. According to their Facebook page, they play "Apocalypse Metal" (sic), nevertheless I would say that if there is one band that has defined the sound and the aesthetics of them, this is<strong>Neurosis</strong>.<strong>Silk Spiders Uderwater...</strong>is their 4th official release (they have also released a split CD with<strong>Vancouver</strong>) and is the first of two concept albums with the second one, named<strong>…Bring Mirrors To The Surface,</strong>scheduledto be released somewhere between 2016 and 2017.</p><p>As you may have already understood,<strong>Zatokrev</strong>play sludge metal BUT there are certain elements in this album that put them in the first league of the genre and -at least to my humble opinion- place them amongst equals next to bands like<strong>Cult Of Luna.</strong>The first one is the production (done in Geneva guaranteeing the presence of the famous Swiss quality in doing things) and which allows the dynamics and the multiple dimensions of the songs to become clear to the listener. The second one is the excellent musicianship which helps the ideas behind the compositions to evolve freely. Having these aces up their sleeves, it is easy for<strong>Zatokrev</strong>to rise and shine in<strong>Silk Spiders Underwater...</strong>Songs like<strong>Bleeding Island</strong>or<strong>Brick In The Sky</strong>, which is the highlight of the CD, have rightfully conquered a place in my sludge/post metal playlists next to masterpieces like<strong>Carry</strong>by<strong>Isis, Stones From the Sky</strong>by<strong>Neurosis</strong>and most recently<strong>Cygnus</strong>by<strong>Cult Of Luna.</strong></p><p><strong>Silk Spiders Underwater...</strong>is(was) one of the best albums of 2015 - it's too bad that I only discovered it in 2016...</p><p>More info/contacts about<strong>Zatokrev</strong>can be found/made in/through the following links :</p><p>Official Site :</p><p>http://www.zatokrev.com/</p><p>Facebook :</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/ZATOKREV</p><p>Bandcamp :</p><p>https://zatokrev.bandcamp.com/</p><p>Soundcloud :</p><p>https://soundcloud.com/zatokrev</p><p>Twitter:</p><p>https://twitter.com/zatokrev</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="191"><!-- react-empty: 192 --></div></section><section id="15" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0  text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="193"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="194"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-33p w-100p ls-w-33p" data-reactid="195"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="196"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="197"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b124dc88e9923d9af8beeb1200bf76e5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa8a74d99-86e2-4888-bcb2-71b1c7df1ab8.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:18.994140625% 76.07421875%;" data-reactid="198"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b124dc88e9923d9af8beeb1200bf76e5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa8a74d99-86e2-4888-bcb2-71b1c7df1ab8.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:18.994140625% 76.07421875%;" data-reactid="199"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e6be15648d69520f0b12300ef36585d9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa8a74d99-86e2-4888-bcb2-71b1c7df1ab8.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:18.994140625% 76.07421875%;" data-reactid="200"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9582bc8cdfef2ffe8b24e3d3aa969446/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa8a74d99-86e2-4888-bcb2-71b1c7df1ab8.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:18.994140625% 76.07421875%;" data-reactid="201"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1200" data-height="1200" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b124dc88e9923d9af8beeb1200bf76e5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa8a74d99-86e2-4888-bcb2-71b1c7df1ab8.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:18.994140625% 76.07421875%;" data-reactid="202"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column ls-min-w-480px col-2 col-gap-s p-2 ls-p-h-8 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-66p color-title" data-reactid="203"><!-- react-empty: 204 --><!-- react-empty: 205 --><!-- react-empty: 206 --><!-- react-empty: 207 --><!-- react-empty: 208 --><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="209"><p data-reactid="210">Act Up Trio - Act Up (2013)</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="211"><p data-reactid="212">Act Up Trio come from Thessaloniki, Greece with the three members consisting the group having a long and significant history in the local and European Jazz scenes.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="213"><p data-reactid="214">Their only release so far is Act Up 7-inch which was recorded live in the Royal Alzheimer Hall studios of Epanomi, Greece during January of 2013 and was subsequently released in July of the same year.

Carrying an obvious (and of course strong) Jazz background, the trio lets the performances evolve and expand freely reaching to a final outcome that several times touches the limits of punk (one observant enough will even notice the word punk in the tag area of group&#x27;s Bandcamp page). Act Up Trio are definitely punk in the way they approach their art and me being brave (and cliche) enough, I would name them Greece&#x27;s answer to John Zorn.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="217"><p data-reactid="218"> If I could find only one fault in Act Up Trio, that would be the limited display of their craft during the 6 years of their existence (they were established in 2010) with this 7-inch being their only release. However all three members are over-productive with their other bands and music projects (one can easily access information about these in bands webpage).</p></div></div></div></section><section id="17" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="219"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="220"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ls-w-66p" data-reactid="221"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="222"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="223"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/554f7ffa8debf5f744076fcc421c4d8b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdcd49efa-488e-47ab-bed5-cf28c69e9bbb.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:37.40234375% 88.57421875%;" data-reactid="224"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/554f7ffa8debf5f744076fcc421c4d8b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdcd49efa-488e-47ab-bed5-cf28c69e9bbb.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:37.40234375% 88.57421875%;" data-reactid="225"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b774760723707ddd601cab3639ec9aa9/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdcd49efa-488e-47ab-bed5-cf28c69e9bbb.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:37.40234375% 88.57421875%;" data-reactid="226"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0a3dde25b0a8f7fc47e1f6226993c9f2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdcd49efa-488e-47ab-bed5-cf28c69e9bbb.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:37.40234375% 88.57421875%;" data-reactid="227"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1200" data-height="1200" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/554f7ffa8debf5f744076fcc421c4d8b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdcd49efa-488e-47ab-bed5-cf28c69e9bbb.jpg&amp;width=1200" style="object-position:37.40234375% 88.57421875%;" data-reactid="228"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-5 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="229"><!-- react-empty: 230 --><!-- react-empty: 231 --><!-- react-empty: 232 --><!-- react-empty: 233 --><!-- react-empty: 234 --><div class="Paragraph color-text " data-reactid="235"><p data-reactid="236">Ringworm / Brain Tentacles Split (2016)</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text " data-reactid="237"><p data-reactid="238">In anticipation of their new album (out on July 29 via Relapse), Ringworm release this special split 7-inch with Jazz-noise super-group Brain Tentacles.

Natvre&#x27;s are coming from Greece but honestly do not expect to hear anything like Rotting Christ or Varathron here. What you are going to experience instead, is one of the best Norwegian Black Metal records that never came out of Norway. Natvre&#x27;s get their influences from bands like Burzum (minus the politics) and Darkthrone (plus better aesthetics) and what really makes them standout is the way that they have digested and finally express these influences in their final artistic outcome. I chose the term &quot;artistic&quot; very carefully here but art is something that is supposed to create sentiments and feelings to people and judging by the chill I get in my spine every time I listen to the eight and half minutes of Hinterland we are definitely talking about art in this case.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="19" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="259"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="260"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="261"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="262"><span data-reactid="263"><!-- react-empty: 264 --><h2 data-reactid="265"><a data-reactid="266">Jupiter Variation</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="267"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="268"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="269"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="270"></div></section></div></div>
